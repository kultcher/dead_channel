- Add heat to camera
- Get full terminal loop with camera

Stray ideas:
	Normal vs. Enhanced cameras:
	Normal is standard heat,
	Enhanced has built in recognition and triggers immediate alerts

	Utility signals:
	Security terminal: disable nearby IC, open doors, reduce difficulty
	Comms terminal: get guard positions, dissipate heat
	Data terminal: pay boost

	T1 ice: reboot, punish, lockout
