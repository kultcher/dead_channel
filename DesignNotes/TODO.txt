Stray ideas:
	Normal vs. Enhanced cameras:
	Normal is standard heat,
	Enhanced has built in recognition and triggers immediate alerts

	Utility signals:
	Security terminal: disable nearby IC, open doors, reduce difficulty
	Comms terminal: get guard positions for a time, or dissipate heat
	Data terminal: pay boost

	Stealing credentials from guards/terminals, escalating credentials
	Access-locked terminals still solvable, credentials let you shortcut
	Credentials decay over time?
	big maybes: keylogger (or social engineering?) for delayed credential access, counter-surveillance on credential usage, ICE credential burn

	- using doors to block line of sight or trap guards

	- linked nodes

	Signal properties instead of or in addition to processes: modify camera FOV, etc.

	T1 ice: reboot, punish, lockout
	- ICE concept: one "board" effect and one "puzzle" effect

	guards "comms pulse" to get brief location hints

"Matrix Search" names:
Sniff
Scrape
Sift
Sweep


Story/Lore stuff:
- white hats as inquisitors and true believers
- maintenance as rituals
- AI-dependence leads to knowledge loss, collapse

Heat isn't just "Alert Level"; it’s "Variance." You are introducing variance into a perfect system.
IC (Intrusion Countermeasures): Instead of distinct software names, they are named after virtues or corporate values.
Standard Cyberpunk: "Killer.exe", "Firewall", "Black ICE".
Dead Channel: "Protocol: Purity", "Asset: Retention", "Human Resources Mitigation".
Terminal Minigame: When you fail a puzzle or decay happens, the text isn't ACCESS DENIED. It’s NON-COMPLIANT. FAITH IN SUITE 3.0 REQUIRED. SUBMIT TICKET FOR PENANCE.
